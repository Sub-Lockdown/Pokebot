# Pokebot

The aim for this discord bot to allow for community Pokemon catching, trading, and battling. 

This is currently an active work in progress and will be updated frequently in the next couple weeks to come. 


### Things I think the bot should have:
----------------------------------------
* Latest rules for Pokemon games (starting with Gen 1 Pokemon 1st)
* Random spawns of pokemon for catch attempts (multiple pokeball types)
* Leveling system for pokemon (nothing grindy, maybe just a simple minigame/battle)
* Pokemon trading (or selling to a 'global market')
* Pokemon battles PVE/PVP
* Gym Leaders

### To use
Currently the bot just connects to the guild (internal name for server), and then responds to $hello by restarting, if sent be someone on the admin list.

First:
        python pokebot.py

This will create the .env file, which then you need to put in the token, server, and who you want to be admins. Then, run it again, and it should connect.

This section will be expanded upon, and include a howto for getting the token and what permissions to assign.
